# EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques- Lab Scenario: Smart Health Assistant System

## INTRODUCTION:
Scenario-Based Report Development involves crafting reports based on
simulated or real-world situations. These scenarios can represent challenges,
incidents, case studies, or strategic decisions relevant to a subject area (e.g.,
business, education, healthcare).
Diverse Prompting Techniques are varied types of questions, cues, or
instructions used to elicit comprehensive responses. These techniques help
structure the analysis, direct focus, and encourage critical thinking.
## Objectives
Encourage critical thinking and problem-solving
Enhance decision-making skills
Support deep reflection using targeted prompts
Improve writing and reporting quality
Simulate real-world application of theoretical knowledge
## Types of Prompting Techniques
Descriptive PromptsAsk the learner to describe a scenario or
process.Example: “Describe what happened in the scenario involving the
cybersecurity breach.”
Analytical PromptsEncourage analysis of causes, effects, or
relationships.Example: “Why did the customer service failure occur? What
were the contributing factors?”
Evaluative PromptsPromote judgment about actions or outcomes.Example:
“Evaluate the response of the management team. Was it effective?”
Predictive PromptsAsk the user to anticipate outcomes or future
implications.Example: “What are the likely consequences if the same
strategy is used again?”
Reflective PromptsEncourage personal insight or lessons learned.Example:
“What would you do differently if you were the project lead?”

4. Creative/Scenario Expansion PromptsPrompt the user to extend or modify
## the scenario.Example: 
“How would the situation change if the budget was doubled?
## Scenario
A travel company is creating a report to inform their customers about
sustainable travel practices.
The company wants a section explaining how tourists can reduce their
environmental impact.
We’ll apply three types of prompting to see how the responses vary in depth,
focus, and clarity.
Example Scenario (Education Sector)
Scenario: A high school is seeing a sharp decline in student performance after
switching to hybrid learning.
## Prompts Used:
Descriptive: Describe the changes in student attendance and engagement.
Analytical: What are the root causes of the performance drop?
Evaluative: Was the hybrid model implemented effectively?
Reflective: What would you recommend to the school board?
Prompts and Responses
## 1. Direct Prompting
Prompt: “Explain how tourists can reduce their environmental impact when
traveling.”
### Response:
"Tourists can reduce their environmental impact by using public transportation
instead of renting cars, staying in eco-friendly accommodations, minimizing
plastic use, conserving water, and respecting local wildlife and natural habitats.
Sustainable travel also includes supporting local businesses and reducing energy
consumption wherever possible."
## Analysis:

- Strengths: Provides a quick, high-level overview of practices.
- Limitations: Lacks specific examples, context, or actionable details. The
response may seem too general for a report aimed at educating customers.
## 2. Iterative Prompting
Initial Prompt: “Explain how tourists can reduce their environmental impact
when traveling.”
Follow-Up Prompt: “Provide more examples and specific actions tourists can
take.”
## Response:
"Tourists can reduce their environmental impact by choosing eco-friendly
transportation options like trains, buses, or electric vehicles when available.
Staying at accommodations certified for environmental responsibility, such as
LEED-certified hotels or eco-lodges, can also reduce energy use.
Packing reusable items like water bottles, bags, and utensils minimizes plastic
waste. Tourists should conserve resources by turning off lights and air
conditioning when leaving their rooms, using towels and linens for multiple
days, and taking shorter showers. Supporting local and small businesses,
especially those with sustainable practices, also reduces the carbon footprint
associated with international supply chains."
## Analysis:
- Strengths: The follow-up prompt encourages more detail and specific
examples, making the response more useful and engaging for readers.
- Limitations: Requires multiple interactions to achieve a comprehensive
answer, which can be time-consuming if many refinements are needed.
## 3. Guided Prompting
Prompt: “Write a paragraph for a travel report that explains five specific actions
tourists can take to reduce their environmental impact. Use a friendly and
i f i ”
informative tone.”
## Response:
"When traveling, tourists can reduce their environmental impact in a few easy
ways. First, opt for public transportation, biking, or walking over renting a car,
which lowers emissions. Second, choose eco-friendly hotels that implement
green practices, like energy-efficient lighting and water-saving fixtures. Third,
pack a reusable water bottle and avoid single-use plastics. Fourth, take shorter
showers and skip daily towel changes to save water and energy. Finally, support
local businesses and farmers' markets, which reduces the carbon footprint from
food and product imports. By making these small changes, travelers can enjoy
their trips while protecting the environment."
## Analysis:
- Strengths: Highly targeted, clear, and organized response. The specified tone
makes the text engaging and customer-friendly.
- Limitations: Limited to exactly what the prompt specifies, which could omit
details if they aren’t requested directly.
## Comparison of Responses:

## Conclusion
Guided prompting delivered the most polished response aligned with the goal
of informingcustomers in a friendly and structured way, making it ideal for
customer-focused reports.
However, iterative prompting was helpful for adding detail when needed, while
direct prompting was quick for generating general ideas.
